# Object-Detection
<li>Using Yolov8n and Yolov8s models</li>
<li>Achieved mAP50 score of 0.993 on Yolov8n and 0.995 on Yolov8s</li>
The motivation of this project is the lack of consensus used by different works and implementations concerning the evaluation metrics of the object detection problem. Although on-line competitions use their own metrics to evaluate the task of object detection, just some of them offer reference code snippets to calculate the accuracy of the detected objects.
